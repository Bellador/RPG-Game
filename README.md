# RPG type game
DaD_Game

This game I develop in my spare time is somewhat a mix between a pok√©mon encounter game and a RPG.
The next steps will involve full GUI implementation by migrating all user input from the terminal.
Equipment (and costumization) items and dropprates from various new NPC enemies will be implemented.  
Also the rogue and mage character shall be implemented at some point in the future.
Feel free to contact me on the game (I know it is really basic and not much to show for) if you have 
some feedback or input under maximilian.hartmann@gmx.ch
